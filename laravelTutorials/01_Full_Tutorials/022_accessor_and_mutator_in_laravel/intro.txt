what is mutator ? 

* a mutator transforms an eloquent attribute value when it is set.

* define a set{Attribute}Attribute method on your model where {Attribute} is the "studly" cased name of the column you wish to access .

to perform mutator >>>

go to the model file and write the follwing code for the field you want to mutate the data ,,, in our case we will setthename 

>>     public function setNameAttribute($value){
        $this->attributes['name'] = ucwords($value);
    }

	afte this code ,,, add some data into the table and you'll see it will automaticslly uppaer case the value of the name field.

>> but it acts different for the field namedwith underscore : example a table's fieelf name is >> user_name 
	for that it will be: 

	1. we will modify our existing table's 'Name' column into 'user_name'
	2. Now , we will change its migration file also .. just replace the name with user_name
	3. now change the name into user_name in the view file 
	4. finally write this code in the model 

	    public function setUserNameAttribute($value){
        $this->attributes['user_name'] = ucwords($value);
    }
